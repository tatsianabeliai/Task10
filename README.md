# Task10
The test task on Junit test framework

Project to this task is correct, do not change Mathematics class!
Complete tasks for training 10:
1.	Download project to this task. Create 2 classes with tests (see details below). Group these classes into suite.
a)	Class 1
Should contain 4 unit tests (for each method in Mathematics class).
b)	Class 2
Create 1 test with empty body.
2.	Ignore test from Class 2 in test run.
3.	Change the order of test execution.
4.	Add before or after class and before or after annotations to Class 1. Methods marked with this annotations should be really helpful for test execution.
5.	Add timeout to some test, update test to make it failing.
6.	Create exception test for one of methods in Mathematics class (not AssertionError).
7.	Create DDT test, you can use pairs of 'x' and 'y' as datasets. Make all possible operations of Mathematics class with each dataset.
8.	Add categories to tests and test classes:
a)	Class 1 add to Slow category.
b)	Class 2 add to Fast category.
c)	Create test runner class, include to test run both categories, observe results.
d)	Exclude Fast category from test run, observe results.
